The projects i'm more confident in while learning MalDev

**Loaders**:

**NtCreateThreadEx**: This loader is nothing special. Its testing out the usage NtCreateThreadEx to execute shellcode in a remote process. It also hides the thread creation from debuggers.

**Chunk Loader**: practicing the chunking/drip allocation methods founded by Filip Olszak: https://github.com/xuanxuan0/. "Evasive shellcode loader for bypassing event-based injection detection, without necessarily suppressing event collection." note There are quite a few opsec blunders here, and things left in or out on purpose. The point of this was to practice the allocation techniques, not create a great loader.

**Threadless Inject**: Threadless Process Injection using remote function hooking. Inspired by Cobbs Threadless inject presentation. Also known as a hook loader. We hook a function in a remote process, overwrite it with shellcode, either a trampoline or payload, and wait for the process to call that function naturally.

**Xll**: Practicing dll hijacking/ghosting and function exports to create different payload types.

**Shellcodes**:

Currently dont have much publicly, but did provide a sleep shellcode/asm pair.
